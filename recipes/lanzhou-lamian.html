    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lanzhou lamian is a Chinese noodle dish that's known for its hand pulled noodles as the dough is stretched and folded repeatedly by hand to create long, thin noodles with a chewy texture.</p>
        <p>The special technique that is used not only aligns the gluten but also enhances the texture of the noodles. The noodles are then cooked in a rich beef broth that is clear and flavourful, served with sliced beef and granished with cilantro, chilli oil and white radish with the option of other garnishes available</p>
